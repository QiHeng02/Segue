Installation:

- run setup.bat to download all python external libraries. (list of libraries used found in requirements.txt)

- if you have trouble running setup.bat you probably dont have pip. install it here: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows

- to run program either run main.py in your IDE or just use run.bat

- initial run will take awhile to load because its downloading a LLM (3GB). Depends on your internet connection but mine took 22mins and I have shit wifi
